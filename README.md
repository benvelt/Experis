# Experis
Here are some of the work I did during my course at Experis.
DS (Data Structures) and ADS (Advanced DS) that I implementd in C.
The OS environment I used is Linux.
When I implemented new DS with an existing one, I used Shared Libraries.
In each folder there are Makefiles for compiling.
There is UT (Unit Test) in each DS and ADS folder of basic tests.
